# AnniversaryGame
Anniversary gift I made for my girlfriend for our 1 year anniversary. Features a timeline of all of the days we spent together. Each date range we were together features minigames including:
-  A Pac-Man recreation
-  A mining game recreated from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl
-  A tile swap puzzle game with pictures from each date range

Please forgive the lack of polish, both in the game itself and the source code - this was created with the intent of being a unique but charming anniversary gift, not to be listed on a job application. I have only included it to highlight my interest in game design and urge to create.
